# Fitness-Tracker
A fitness tracker application that uses Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose to view, create, and track daily workouts. The user is able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day; be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of the exercise; and if the exercise is cardio, the user can track the distance traveled.
